#  C++ Notebook
My notes for C++!

## _The basics_
We have the following ways to designate variables in our programs. 
Note that every variable must be preceded by its type.
```
int i, j, k
int n = 1, m
float particles, sand_grains
```


To print text on the console, we can use `cout` and the operator `<<` 
like so:
```
cout << "I love you, this world, and everyone in it!"
cout << "I love " << "sweet things!" # The text will be printed from left to right
```
To take an input into our program, we can use `cin` and the operator `>>`:
```
int plates
cin >> plates
```
### Data Types
| Data Type  | Description                | Extra tips |
|------------|----------------------------|------------|
| `char`     | For singular characters    |            |
| `int`      | For integers               |            |
| `short`    | For smaller integers       |            |
| `long`     | For larger integers        |            |
| `unsigned` | For positive integers ONLY |            |
| `float`    | For floats (real numbers)  |            |

* You can use `\n` in the middle of a `string` to make a jump in line.
